# electron-livereload-starter

This electron starter uses webpack-dev-server to automatically reload changes while developing.

```shell
npm install
#runs webpack dev server which compile dynamically app/index.js
npm run start-dev
#starts the electron
npm run start
```

You can now edit app/index.js and see your changes reloaded in your running
electron app.
